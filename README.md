# Updated Portfolio Assignment

Just added hyperlinks and images to the existing portfolio, I'm not loving the layout anymore since I created the original and will be changing it after the next project but most likely will shift gears completely on what I want on here.

For my portfolio I used it in regards to a LLC that I own called Savage Technology Solutions. Primarily for infrastructure currently BUT looking to expand my skillset too. The Developer/SEO and other items are placeholders for future work that I can add here or other pages. 

# Icons 
I wanted to add some social media icons on this to let clients or possible boss view another page regarding education, background, work history reviews etc. So I linked in my LinkedIn profile, Github and although no necissary my Instagram handle.

Whenever the icons are clicked, BOOM! Hyperlink and blast off to the website. 


# Cards
