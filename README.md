For my portfolio I used it in regards to a LLC that I own called Savage Technology Solutions. Primarily for infrastructure currently BUT looking to expand my skillset too. The Developer/SEO and other items are placeholders for future work that I can add here or other pages. 

# Icons 
I wanted to add some social media icons on this to let clients or possible boss view another page regarding education, background, work history reviews etc. So I linked in my LinkedIn profile, Github and although no necissary my Instagram handle.
